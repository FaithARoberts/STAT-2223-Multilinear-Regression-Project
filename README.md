GUIDE FOR RUNNING SAS CODE:
  1: Download finalProjectCode.sas AND rawData.csv  
    
  2: Put them in the same folder - any folder will do, as long as they are together  
    
  3: Open the .sas file in SAS and read the ***IMPORTANT*** comment  
  
  4: Follow the comment directions for what path to replace. YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO REPLACE 1 PATH IN 1 SPOT NEAR THE TOP OF THE FILE  
  
  5: Run the code! (it may take a minute to finish running)  
  finalProjectCode.sas will finish cleaning the data, generate the dummy variables, and create the models.
